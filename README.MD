# Zwitter

- In modern society, almost no one can live without using social media. Social media has been integrated into our daily
  lives, with 59% of the world's population using social media for an average of 2 hours and 29 minutes per day (by
  Global WebIndex).
- Many social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. are monetized by inserting ads or membership systems,
  which also affects some user experience.
- Our application, Zwitter, was designed to be a social media outlet that is in line with the perceptions of the young
  people of Generation Z (the generation born between 1997 and 2012). It will be divided into several sections according
  to the interests that young people like. Users can express their opinions and share and like the content they like.

- The application will be deployed on the cloud using Google Firebase and Heroku.

```

Once commands run successfully, you will have your client web app on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and
Socket.io server on 'ws://localhost:5000/'!

## How the Application Works

Upon loading the website, the first page will be the home page.

A non-authenticated user will be able to view the list of Zwitter. When user click one Zwitter, the webpage will show
the detail of Zwitter. Only authenticated users will be able to upload or reply Zwitter, view or edit their profile, and
create or join chatroom.

For chatroom, authenticated users can create a room after setting room name and room password. Other user will be able
to view the list of room in chatroom page. They can join the room after verifying password of room. In the chatroom all
the users can communicate with each other.
